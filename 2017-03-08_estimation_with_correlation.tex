\DiaryEntry{Estimation of correlated Random Variables}{2017-03-08}{Stochastic}

We have two random variables $\thetabf = [\theta_1\, \theta_2]^T$ with distribution

\bee
\thetabf \sim \Nc(\zerobf, \Lambda^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{bmatrix})
\eee

and observe a vector $\ybf = [y_1\, y_2]^T$ according to

\bee
\ybf = \thetabf + \wbf
\eee

with $\wbf \sim \Nc(\zerobf, \Lbf^{-1} = \sigma_w^2 \Ibf)$.

\subsection{MMSE Estimation}

We want the MMSE estimator $\hat\thetabf$ which can be expressed as

\bee
\hat \thetabf = \Abf \ybf
\eee

with the matrix $\Abf$ given by

\bee
\Abf = (\Lambda + \Lbf)^{-1} \Lbf
\eee
%
I wonder whether it's possible to get an analytic result out of this (at least for asympotitc cases). We have

\bee
\Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & \rho \\ \rho & 1 \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{1-\rho^2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\rho \\ -\rho & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\eee
%
and

\bee
\Lbf = \frac{1}{\sigma_w^2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
\eee
%
and one can get an analytical expression for $\Abf$, but it's not really helpful...

The special cases below are obtained via numerical analysis (Julia).

\paragraph{No noise, no correlation.} In this case, the matrix $\Abf$ gets the asymptotic form

\bee
\Abf = \Ibf
\eee
%
i.e. in order to estimate $\theta_1$, only the observation $y_1$ is utilized. There is no noise; therefore no prior information is used and there is no correlation; therefore only $y_1$ is used.


\paragraph{No noise, perfect correlation.} In this case, the matrix $\Abf$ gets the asymptotic form

\bee
\Abf = \begin{bmatrix} 1/2 & 1/2 \\ 1/2 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix}
\eee
%
The prior information is ignored (no noise), but both observations are utilized equally as the two RVs are perfectly correlated.
