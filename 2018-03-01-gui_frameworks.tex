\DiaryEntry{GUI Frameworks}{2018-03-01}{General}


\subsection{Tasks}

Write visualization for Game of Life

\begin{itemize}
	\item Display board with cells
	\item Allow start / stop / reset of simulation
	\item Click-able cells to change state
\end{itemize}

Write infection spread simulation

\begin{itemize}
	\item Observe state of single persons
	\item Change parameters (density, infection prob...)
	\item Create diagrams with number of healthy / infected / dead persons
	\item Store time series in file
\end{itemize}

Other Ideas: Hex Viewer, which displays file content as hex, allows editing...

\subsection{Solutions}

\paragraph{General Observation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Writing a comprehensive GUI framework is a lot of work and a hard task
	\item Therefore, there are not that many options
	\item New ("modern") languages (e.g. Rust, Scala...) reuse existing stuff and do not create new frameworks. There is some kind of "impedance mismatch" between the new languages and the "old" frameworks
\end{itemize}



\subsection{General Purpose}

Qt + C++
\begin{itemize}
	\item The "full-blown", maximum-complexity solution
	\item Qt hides some complexity of C++, but still - it is there (e.g. header and source files)
\end{itemize}


Qt + QML/C++
\begin{itemize}
	\item No experience with QML
	\item QML seems to reduce the complexity of the GUI description only (it is a declarative description of the GUI); apart from very simple things, the business logic cannot be done in QML
	\item A more complex application logic needs Javascript or C++ and the interplay does not seem to be dead-easy.
\end{itemize}


React.js
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completely unknown, no experience in Javascript
	\item Toolchain?, editor support?
	\item Don't know if a browser-based solution fulfills all requirements (e.g. storing to disk, network operations)
	\item Seems to be widely used
\end{itemize}

Pharo
\begin{itemize}
	\item The language and GUI look nice and seem to be fairly comprehensive
	\item Good documentation, but don't know how big the community is
	\item A new language, no experience
\end{itemize}


Lazarus
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phew, I don't know :-) Pascal
    \item It looks fairly complete
    \item Less comprehensive documentation than e.g. Qt
    \item Some people in microcontroller.net are pretty fanatic about it (I don't know if this is a plus or minus)
    \item Probalby thin third-party library support; use only for GUI stuff
\end{itemize}

CSharp + WinForms/GTKSharp
\begin{itemize}
	\item Why is Monodevelop not in Archlinux? Is there some issue with Linux support?
	\item The CSharp language is pretty nice and modern
	\item Lots of documentation from the Windows world
\end{itemize}

Rust + GTK
\begin{itemize}
	\item Looks fairly complete and useful (both the GTK framework and the bindings)
	\item The whole borrowing concept seems to be rather painful with GUIs, especially callbacks and accessing / modifying global 
	\item Don't know if the language is a good match for the task
	\item Long compile times
\end{itemize}


Python + Qt
\begin{itemize}
	\item Qt is comprehensive and well-documented; although it is not always clear, how the Python bindings work
	\item Qt GUI designer can be used; i.e. it is possible to draw the GUI, save a ui file, and use it from Python
	\item Python has a large ecosystem with tons of documentation, tools, and libraries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Multi-Agent Simulation Frameworks}

There actually several of them
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://repast.github.io/index.html}{Repast}: Looks rather complex (Java / Groovy programming via an adapted Eclipse GUI)
	\item \href{http://gama-platform.org}{Gama}: A dedicated language necessary to learn. Looks rather complex, but the whole framework feels rather comprehensive and professional (store stuff infiles, make plots, GIS support...)
	\item \href{http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo}{Netlogo}: This looks nice and is probably simpler than the GAMA platform from above.Still, it is another language necessary to learn.
\end{itemize}
