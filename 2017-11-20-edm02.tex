This entry discusses some issues that arose while implementing the "classical MDS" algorithm from the paper.


\subsection{The effect of scaling on angles}

Consider two vectors $v_1, v_2$ which are taken as

\bee
v_1 = [1 0]^T, v_2=[\cos \alpha \sin \alpha]^T
\eee

with $\alpha \in \mR$. The inner product of two vectors is defined as

\bee
v_1^T v_2 = ||v_1|| \cdot ||v_2|| \cos \phi
\eee

where $\phi$ is the angle between the two vectors. The inner product of the two vectors from above is

\bee
v_1^T v_2 = \cos \alpha
\eee

since they both are unit-length vectors. Now assume that the vectors are scaled by a matrix S, $S v_1$, $Sv_2$, with $S$ given by

\bee
S = \begin{bmatrix}
	s_x       & 0 \\
	0         & s_y
\end{bmatrix}
\eee

and consider the effect the scaling has on the inner product. We have

\bee
(Sv_1)^T (S v_2) = v_1^T S^T S v_2 = v_1^T 
\begin{bmatrix}
	s_x^2       & 0 \\
	0           & s_y^2
\end{bmatrix}
v_2 = s_x^2 \cos \alpha
\eee

The lengths of the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ are

\bee
||v_1|| = s_x , \qquad ||v_2|| = \sqrt{s_x^2 \cos^2 \alpha + s_y^2 \sin^2 \alpha}
\eee

Therefore

\bee
s_x^2 \cos \alpha = s_x \sqrt{s_x^2 \cos^2 \alpha + s_y^2 \sin^2 \alpha} \cos \alpha'
\eee

where $\alpha'$ denotes the angle between the scaled vectors $S_v1$ and $Sv_2$. Solving for $\cos \alpha'$ yields

\bee
\cos \alpha' = \frac{s_x \cos \alpha}{\sqrt{s_x^2 \cos^2 \alpha + s_y^2 \sin^2 \alpha}}
\eee

In general, the original angle $\alpha$ and the angle of the scaled vectors $\alpha'$ will differ; only in the special case of $s_x=s_y$, the two will be the same:

\bee
\cos \alpha' = \frac{s_x \cos \alpha}{\sqrt{s_x^2 \cos^2 \alpha + s_x^2 \sin^2 \alpha}} = \frac{\cos \alpha}{\sqrt{\cos^2 \alpha + \sin^2 \alpha}} = \cos \alpha
\eee
