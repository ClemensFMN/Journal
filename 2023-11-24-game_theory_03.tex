\DiaryEntry{Game Theory, Mixed-Strategy Equilibrium}{2023-11-24}{Game Theory}

Some games do not have a Nash equilibrium. Consider, for example, the matching pennies game shown in Figure 9.2. In this game, no strategy profile is stable because each one has a “winner” and a “loser” — a status that is flipped if either player alters his or her strategy. In matching pennies, players actually have an interest in deceiving each other. 

Suppose that player 1 has privately decided to select strategy H. This would be rational if player 1 thought that player 2 would select 2 as well, but player 2's selection of H relies on a belief that player 1 is am likely to play T. In other words, player 1 would like player 2 to believe that player 1 will choose T while, in fact, player 1 plans to select H. Coordination of beliefs and behavior is, in this example, seemingly at odds with best-response behavior.

If one player can accurately predict the other player's strategy, as would be the case in equilibrium, then he can take advantage of the other (for example, by selecting T while he choses H). Therefore, it is not good that other player(s) know which strategy one player is using.

One way to achieve this is to randomize between H and T. This raises the question whether there a mixed-strategy profile that has the equilibrium property?

Note that if each player randomizes with probability $1/2$ on both strategies, then neither player has a strict incentive to play H or T; in fact, all strategies -- H, T, and every mixed strategy -- are best responses to the opponent randomizing with equal probability. To see this, observe that if player 2 plays H and T with equal probabilities, then player 1 will get an expected payoff of zero -- that is, $1/2 \times 1 + 1/2 \times (-1) = 0$ -- regardless of whether player 1 choses H or T. In addition, if player 1 also mixes between H and T, his expected payoff will still be zero.

If we therefore extend the definitions of best response and equilibrium to mixed strategies, we find that the mixed-strategy profile $(1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1/2)$, where both players randomize equally between their pure strategies, has the Nash equilibrium property in the matching pennies game. With this mixed-strategy profile, each player is best responding to the other. We then can say that the profile $(1/2, 1/2), (1/2, 1/2)$ is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the matching pennies game.

The formal definition is as follows.

\begin{definition}
    Consider a strategy profile $\sigma = (\sigma_1 , \sigma_2 \ldots, , \sigma_n)$, where $s_i \in \Delta S_i$ for each player $i$. Profile $s$ is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium if and only if $u_i(\sigma_i , \sigma_{-i}) \geq u_i(s'_i , \sigma_{-i})$ for each $s'_i \in S_i$ and each player $i$. That is, $\sigma_i$ is a best resposne to $\sigma_{-i}$ for every player $i$.
\end{definition}

For a mixed strategy to be a best response (as required in the definition), it must put positive probability only on pure strategies that are best responses. This demonstrates how to calculate a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium.

As an example consider the following game which is lobbying game between two firms.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

Each firm may lobby the government in hopes of persuading the government to make a decision that is favorable to the firm. The two firms, X and Y, independently and simultaneously decide whether to lobby (L) or not (N). Lobbying entails a cost of $15$. Not lobbying costs nothing. If both firms lobby or neither firm lobbies, then the government takes a neutral decision, which yields $10$ to both firms. A firm’s payoff is this value minus the lobbying cost if it lobbied. If firm Y lobbies and firm X does not lobby, then the government makes a decision that favors firm Y, yielding zero to firm X and $30$ to firm Y. Thus, firm Y’s payoff in this case is $30 - 15 = 15$. If firm X lobbies and firm Y does not lobby, then the government makes a decision that favors firm X, yielding $40$ to firm X (so X’s payoff is $40 - 15 = 25$) and zero to firm Y.

There are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria in this game, (N,L) and (L,N); in these points no player has an incentive to deviate from the chosen strategy.

In addition to these pure-strategy equilibria, there is also a mixed-strategy equilibrium. To find it, recall what must hold in a mixed-strategy equilibrium: a player must achieve a best response by selecting a mixed strategy. For example, let’s guess that firm X mixes between L and N. If this strategy is optimal for firm X (in response to the other firm’s strategy), then it must be that the expected payoff from playing L equals the expected payoff from playing N; otherwise, firm X would strictly prefer to pick either L or N.

But how can firm X’s strategies L and N yield the same expected payoff? It must be that firm Y’s behavior generates this expectation (because if firm Y played a pure strategy, then X would strictly prefer one of its strategies over the other). Let $q$ denote the probability that firm Y plays L; that is, $(q, 1 - q)$ is firm Y’s mixed strategy. Against this mixed strategy, firm X expects to earn

\bee
q(-5) + (1-q)25 = 25 - 30q
\eee

by choosing L and

\bee
q0 + (1-q)10 = 10 - 10q
\eee

by choosing N. For firm X to be willing to randomize, it must be that $25 - 30q = 10 - 10q$. This simplifies to $q = 3/4$. In other words, firm X can randomize in playing a best response if firm Y’s strategy is $(3/4, 1/4)$.

Let us move on to firm Y’s incentives and let $p$ be the probability that firm X plays L. Then, if firm Y selects L, its expected payoff is

\bee
p(-5) + (1-p)15 = 15 - 20p
\eee

By choosing N, its expected payoff is

\bee
p0 + (1-p)10 = 10-10p
\eee

Firm Y is indifferent between its two strategies (and therefore willing to randomize) if $15 - 20p = 10 - 10p$, which simplifies to $p = 1/2$.

The mixed-strategy profile $((1/2, 1/2), (3/4, 1/4))$ is a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. Given firm Y’s mixed strategy, firm X’s mixed strategy is a best response -- in fact, every strategy is a best response for firm X. Likewise, given firm X’s strategy, firm Y’s prescribed strategy is a best response. Note that constructing a mixed-strategy equilibrium entails an interesting new twist: we look for a mixed strategy for one player that makes the other player indifferent between her pure strategies. This is the best method of calculating mixed-strategy equilibria.
