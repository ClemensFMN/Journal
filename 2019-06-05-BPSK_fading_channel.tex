\DiaryEntry{BPSK Transmission over a Fading Channel}{2019-06-05}{Stochastic}

We have a binary sequence with bits $b$ which we map onto BPSK symbols $s$ ($0 \rightarrow -1, 1 \rightarrow 1$) and transmit across a channel with gain $h$. After demodulation, the receiver observes $y$ according to

\bee
y = h s + w, \quad w \sim \Nc(0, \sigma_w^2)
\eee

The receiver makes a hard decision to obtain bit estimates $\hat b$ according to

\bee
\hat b = \begin{cases} 1 \, \text{if}\, y > 0 \\ 0 \, \text{if}\, y \leq 0 \end{cases}
\eee

The conditional pdf $f(y|b$ is given by 

\bee
f(y|s) = \Nc(y, hs, \sigma_w^2)
\eee

and from this we can retrieve the error probability

\bee
P(\Ec) = f(y \leq 0 | s = 1) = \int_{y \leq 0} \Nc(y, h, \sigma_w^2) dy = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \erf \left( \frac{-h}{\sqrt{2\sigma_w^2}} \right) \right]
\eee

\todo{Assume that h has Gaussian distribution, we can now average the error probability over h...}
