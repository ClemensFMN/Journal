\subsection{Vector Norms}

A \emph{norm} is a function $|| \cdot || : \mC^m \rightarrow \mC$ mapping a vector to a real number. In order for a function to be a norm, it must fulfill the following three conditions ($\xbf, \ybf$ are vectors, $\alpha$ is a scalar)

\begin{align*}
  & || \xbf || \geq 0, || \xbf || = 0 \quad \text{iff} \quad \xbf = \zerobf \\
  & || \xbf + \ybf || \leq || \xbf || + || \ybf || \\
  & || \alpha \xbf || = |\alpha| || \xbf ||
\end{align*}

There are several norms widely used. The $1$-norm is defined as

\bee
|| \xbf ||_1 = \sum_i | x_i |
\eee

The ``classical'' $2$-norm is

\bee
|| \xbf ||_2 = \sum_i | x_i |^2
\eee

The inifinity-norm is

\bee
|| \xbf ||_\infty = \max_i | x_i |
\eee

A generalization is the $p$-norm which is given by

\bee
|| \xbf ||_p = \left( \sum_i | x_i |^p \right)^{1/p}
\eee

We can also define weighted $p$-norms,

\bee
|| \xbf ||_W = || \Wbf \xbf ||
\eee

with a diagonal matrix $\Wbf$ in which the $i$-th diagonal entry is the weight $w_i \neq 0$. For example, a weighted $2$-norm is given by

\bee
|| \xbf ||_W = \left( \sum_i | w_i x_i |^2 \right)^{1/2}
\eee

\subsection{Matrix Norms induced by Vector Norms}

We are (mostly) interested in matrix norms \emph{induced} by vector norms. Consider an $m \times n$ matrix $\Abf$ and two vector norms $||\cdot||_{(m)}$ and $||\cdot||_{(n)}$. The induced matrix norm $||\Abf ||_{(m,n)}$ is then the smallest number $C$ for which the following inequality holds for all $\xbf \in \mC^n$

\bee
||\Abf \xbf ||_{(m)} \leq C || \xbf ||_{(n)}
\eee

In other words, the induced matrix norm is the supremum of the ratios $||\Abf \xbf ||_{(m)} / ||\xbf ||_{(n)}$ over all vectors $\xbf$; i.e. the maximum factor by which $\Abf$ can stretch a vector $\xbf$. Since everything is linear, we can restrict ourselves to unit vectors and obtain

\bee
\Abf ||_{(m,n)} = \sup_{\xbf \in \mC^m, || \xbf||_{(n)} = 1} ||\Abf \xbf ||_{(m)}
\eee
