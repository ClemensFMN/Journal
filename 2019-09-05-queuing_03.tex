\DiaryEntry{Queuing Theory, Applications}{2019-09-05}{Stochastic}

Before we continue with the infinite queue with one server, we cover some relations which are valid for any queue.

\subsection{Little's Law}

Little's law relates the expected number of jobs in the system, $E(N)$, with the mean time jobs spend in the system, $E(T)$ as follows,

\bee
E(N) = \lambda E(T)
\eee

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of the system. This law is \emph{independent} from the arrival process, service time distribution, network topology, and service order!

Intuitively, the law makes sense: In a fast-food restaurant, $E(T)$ will be low (people get and eat their food quickly), therefore not many people are in the fast-food restaurant; i.e. $E(N)$ is low as well. In a slow-service restaurant, $E(T)$ will be hig (people wait longer for their food) and therefore, more people will be in the restaurant and $E(N)$ will therefore be higher.


\subsection{Infinite Queue with one Server}

Recall the expression for the limiting distribution $\pi_i$ from the previous entry,

\bee
\pi_i = \left( 1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \right) \left(\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\right)^i = \rho^i (1-\rho)
\eee

where we have introduced the utilization $\rho$ as $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}$. We can use this expression to calculate the mean number of jobs in the system, $E(N)$,

\bee
E(N) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty i \pi_i = \sum_{i=1}^\infty i \rho^i(1-\rho) = (1-\rho) \sum_{i=1}^\infty i \rho^i = \rho (1-\rho) \sum_{i=1}^\infty i \rho^{i-1}
\eee

We can use now the standard trick to recognize the sum expression as $d \rho^i / di$ and can rewrite the expression as

\bee
E(N) = \rho (1-\rho) \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{\rho^{i}}{di} = \rho(1-\rho) \frac{d}{di} \sum_{i=1}^\infty \rho^{i} = \rho(1-\rho) \frac{d}{di} \left( \frac{1}{1-\rho} \right) = \rho (1-\rho) \frac{1}{(1-\rho)^2} = \frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \qed
\eee

The variance can be shown to be

\bee
\text{Var}(N) = \frac{\rho}{(1-\rho)^2}
\eee

From the mean expression, we can calculate the mean time in the system (by means of Little's law),

\bee
E(T) = \frac{E(N)}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}
\eee

and the mean time a job waits in the queue as

\bee
E(T_Q) = E(T) - \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{\rho}{\mu - \lambda}
\eee

All these expressions increase sharply, when the arrival rate comes near the mean job processing duration; $\lambda \rightarrow \mu$; i.e. the system becomes overloaded.

\paragraph{Simulation Results.} The Julia file \href{https://github.com/ClemensFMN/JuliaStuff/blob/master/SimJulia/simple_queue.jl}{here} contains a simulation using the SimJulia framework.

The following Figure shows the histogram of $T$ for $\lambda=2, \mu=5 $ which follows an exponential distribution. The expected value $E(T)=\frac{1}{\mu - \lambda} = \frac{1}{3}$ matches the simulation value ($0.33$) quite closely.

\begin{figure}[hbt!]

\end{figure}

Simulation allows experimenting with other distributions for the arrival and / or job processing process. As an example, the Figure below shows the histogram of the same system with a uniform job processing distribution (uniform in the interval $[0,0.4]$ and therefore having the same mean as the exponential job processing distribution from before).

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/queuing_3_2.png}
\end{figure}

Since the uniform distribution has finite support there are no jobs running longer than $0.4$ and we therefore expect the mean of $T$ is shorter (it is $0.288$); however, the histogram looks quite different.
