Differentiate $\ln(x), \log_a(x), a^x$

\paragraph{Differentiate $\ln(x)$.} We start with $y = f(x)=e^x$ and $x = g(y) = \ln y$. In order to calculate the derivative of the inverse function, we do (with slight abuse of notation)

\bee
g'(y) = \frac{1}{f' \left( f^{-1}(y) \right)} = \frac{1}{e^x} = \frac{1}{e^{\ln y}} = \frac{1}{y} \qed
