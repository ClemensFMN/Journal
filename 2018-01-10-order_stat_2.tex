\DiaryEntry{Order Statistics, 2}{2018-01-10}{Stochastic}

Consider $N=3$ RVs each with uniform distribution. The distribution of minimum and maximum has been done (part 1), this entry deals with the statistics of $X_{(2)}$. Using the previous results, we obtain for $N=3, k=2$,

\bee
F_2(x) = \sum_{i=2}^3 {3 \choose i} F^i(x) \left[ 1 - F(x) \right]^{3-i}
\eee

which can be expanded into

\bee
F_2(x) = 3 F^2(x) \left[ 1 - F(x) \right] + F^3(x)
\eee

With the cdf of the uniform distribution

\bee
F(x) = \begin{cases}
	0 \quad &x < 0 \\
	x \quad &0 \geq x \geq 1 \\
	1 \quad &x > 1
\end{cases}
\eee

we obtain

\bee
F_1(x) = \begin{cases}
	0 \quad &x < 0 \\
	3x^2(1-x) + x^3 = x^2(3-2x)\quad &0 \geq x \geq 1 \\
	1 \quad &x > 1
\end{cases}
\eee

The corresponding pdf is

\bee
f_1(x) = \begin{cases}
	0 \quad &x < 0 \\
	6x(1-x) \quad &0 \geq x \geq 1 \\
	1 \quad &x > 1
\end{cases}
\eee 

The following plot shows the estimated pdf (y2) compared to the analytical result (y1). It is somewhat intuitive that the "mid-value" $X_{(2)}$ is most likely to be around $1/2$.

For increasing values of odd $N$, the distribution of the "mid-value" $X_{((N+1)/2)}$ is symmetric around $1/2$ and becomes more and more peaky.

The following plot shows the order statistics for $N=10$ for a normal distribution ($y_k$ being the pdf of $Y_{(k)}$). The peaks of the pdfs are in increasing order; this intuitively makes sense as the random values are ordered.

The following Figure shows the same plot for $N=10$ using a uniform distribution.

And finally, a uniform distribution with $N=20$. The pdf peaks are in increasing order; furthermore, we observe that with $N$ increasing, the pdfs are more closely packed together.
