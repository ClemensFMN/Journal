\begin{theorem}
  Let $f$ be a flow on $G$, $G_f$ be a residual network of $G$ induced by $f$, and let $f'$ be a flow in $G_f$. Then the function $f \uparrow f'$ is a flow in $G$ with value $|f + f'| = |f| + |f'|.$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Not sure if we want to provde this...

\begin{theorem}
  Let $f$ be a flow in a flow network $G$ and let $(S,T)$ be any cut of $G$. Then the net flow across $(S,T)$ is $|f|$; in particular it is indepenent of the cut.

\begin{theorem}[Max-flow Min-cut Theorem]
  If $f$ is a flow in a flow network $G$ with source $s$ and sink $t$, the following conditions are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $f$ is a maximum flow in $G$
  \item The residual network $G_f$ contains no augmenting paths.
  \item The flow $|f|$ equals the flow across a cut: $|f| = c(S,T)$ for any cut $(S,T)$ of $G$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  TBD
\end{proof}
