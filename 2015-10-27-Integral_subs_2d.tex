\DiaryEntry{2D Integral Substitution}{2015-10-27}{Integrals}

We want to solve a 2D-integral

\[ I = \int_x \int_y f(x,y) dy dx \]

and want to perform a substitution: $x = x(u, v); y = y(u; v)$. The integrand then becomes $f(u,v)$. In addition we need to transform the "$dx dy$-square" into its equivalent "$du dv$-square". This is
achieved by the Jacobian matrix which is defined as:

\[ J(u,v) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\partial x(u,v)}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x(u,v)}{\partial v}  \\
\frac{\partial y(u,v)}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y(u,v)}{\partial v} 
\end{array} \right) \]

Then the integral can be rewritten as

\[ I = \int_x \int_y f(x,y) dy dx = \int_u \int_v f(u,v) |J(u,v)| dv du \]

with $|J(u,v)|$ denoting the determinant of the Jacobian Matrix.

\subsubsection{Simple Example}

As a toy example, consider the integral which can be solved by
elementary means

\[ I = \int_{x=0}^1 \int_{y=0}^1 x y^2 dy dx = \frac{1}{6}\]

Making the substitution $u=x/2, v=3y$ leads to $x=2u, y=v/3$ and to the following Jacobian Matrix:

\[J(u,v) = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{3} \end{array} \right) \]

With the determinant being
$|J(u,v)| = \frac{2}{3}$, we arrive at (note the changed integration intervals!):

\[I = \int_{u=0}^{\frac{1}{2}} \int_{v=0}^3 2u \frac{v^2}{9} \frac{2}{3} dv du = \frac{1}{6}\]

\subsubsection{Solving the Integrals with SymPy}

... works as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
import sympy as sym
x, y = sym.symbols("x y")

res = sym.integrate(x*y**2, (x,0,1), (y,0,1))
sym.pprint(res)

res_subs = sym.integrate(2/3*2*x*y**2/9, (x,0,1/2), (y,0,3))
sym.pprint(res)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Polar Coordinates}

Consider the substitution from rectangular coordinates to polar
coordinates with the transformation rules $x = r \cos \phi; y = r \sin \phi $. The Jacobian therefore becomes

\[J(r, \phi) = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \frac{\partial x}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \phi} \\ \frac{\partial y}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \phi} \end{array} \right)
 = \left( \begin{array}{cc} \cos \phi & -r \sin \phi \\ \sin \phi & r \cos \phi \end{array} \right) \]

The determinant is $|J(r, \phi)| = r \cos^2 \phi + r \sin^2 \phi = r$ and therefore we have for the integral

\[ I = \int_x \int_y f(x,y) dy dx = \int_r \int_\phi f(r \cos\phi, r \sin\phi) r dr d\phi \]
