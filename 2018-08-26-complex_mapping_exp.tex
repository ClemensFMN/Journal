\DiaryEntry{Complex Functions as Mapping: Exponential}{2018-08-26}{Maths}


Consider the complex function

\bee
w = e^z
\eee

We make the following observations

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Going in the imaginary direction from $z$ to $z+j2\pi$ corresponds to going along a circle from $e^z$ to $e^{z+j2\pi} = e^z$; i.e. the mapping is $2\pi$-periodic in imaginary direction.

	\item Going along the real axis from $A$ to $B$ amount to going from $e^A$ to $e^B$.

	\item The grey rectangle $A$-$B$-$B+j2\pi$-$A+j2\pi$ is mapped onto a dough-nut with radii $e^A$ and $e^B$. Point $0$ in the $w$-space is only reached for $A \rightarrow -\infty$.
	
\end{itemize}
