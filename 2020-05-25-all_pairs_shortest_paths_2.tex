\DiaryEntry{All-Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm}{2020-05-25}{ALgorithm}

In this entry we consider the Floyd-Warshal algorithm, which is another way to solve the all-pairs shortest path problem.

We denote by $d_{i,j}^{(k)}$ the weight of the shortest path from vertex $i$ to $j$ for which all intermediate vertices are in the set $1,2,\ldots,k$. When $k=0$, the path from vertex $i$ to $j$ has no intermediate vertices at all; therefore the path has one edge and therefore $d_{i,j}^{(0)} = w_{i,j}$.  For longer paths we have the following recursion (proof omitted)

\bee
d_{i,j}^{(k)} = \begin{cases} w_{i,j} & \quad k=0 \\
  \min \left( d^{(k-1)}_{i,j}, d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} + d^{(k-1)}_{k,j}  \right) & \quad k \geq 1
  \end{cases}
\eee

For any path, all intermediate vertices are in the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$; therefore the final result is $d^{(n)}_{i,j} = \delta(i,j)$. We can collect these values in a matrix $\Dbf^{(n)}$.


\paragraph{Algorithm Definition.} The algorithm is contained in the following pseudo-code.

\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left, xleftmargin=5mm]
FLoyd-Warshal(W)
   n = W.rows
   D(0) = W
   for k = 1 to n
      D(k) = zero(n,n)
      for i = 1 to n
         for j = 1 to n
            d(i,j,k) = min(d(i,j,k-1), d(i,k,k-1) + w(k,j,k-1))
   return D(n)
\end{Verbatim}


\paragraph{Shortest Path Construction.} We consider calculating the predecessor matrix within the above algorithm. Specifically, we compute a sequence of predecesor matrices $\Pi^{(0)}, \Pi^{(1)}, \ldots, \Pi^{(n)}$ and define $\pi_{i,j}^{(k)}$ as predecessor of veretx $j$ on a shortest path from $i$ with all intermediate vertices in the set $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. We therefore have

\bee
\pi_{i,j}^{(k)} = \begin{cases} \text{NIL} & \text{if } i=j \text{ or } w_{i,j} = \infty \\
  i & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ or } w_{i,j} < \infty \end{cases}
\eee

For recursion, we use

\bee
\pi_{i,j}^{(k)} = \begin{cases} \pi_{i,j}^{(k-1)} & \text{if } d^{(k-1)}_{i,j} \leq d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} + d^{(k-1)}_{k,j} \\
  \pi_{k,j}^{(k-1)} & \text{if } d^{(k-1)}_{i,j} > d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} + d^{(k-1)}_{k,j}
  \end{cases}
\eee
